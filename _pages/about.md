About Me
=====
I am a researcher at the Korea Electronics Technology Institute (KETI), where I work on optimizing I/O performance in storage systems and accelerating large-scale data processing for AI frameworks.

I received the master’s degree in computer science from Sookmyung Women’s University, advised by [Prof. Dongchul Park](http://bigdata.cau.ac.kr/).

I am broadly interested in **computer systems**; <br />
Optimizing I/O efficiency and resource management across heterogeneous computing environments.
