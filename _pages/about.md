About Me
=====
I received the master’s degree in computer science from Sookmyung Women’s University, Seoul, Republic of Korea, in 2024, advised by [Prof. Dongchul Park](http://bigdata.cau.ac.kr/).

I am broadly interested in **computer systems**; <br />
big data processing software platforms, parallel & distributed computing, storage systems, non-volatile memory, Compute Express Link (CXL) technologies and applications, etc.

I am currently preparing to apply for CS Ph.D. programs in the USA for 2025 admission. <br />
Please feel free to reach out to me for further information!
